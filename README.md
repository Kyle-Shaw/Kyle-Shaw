## Notable Projects

- **[Roamr](https://github.com/CameronDeMarco/CS-304/tree/dev):** Roamr is a cross-platform social media app for Android and iOS, allowing users to share and explore outdoor adventures such as hiking, rock climbing, fishing, and kayaking.

- **[TutorLink](https://github.com/suhalip/SNHU-TutorLink):** A tutor appointment android app for students at SNHU. Using a local test dataset of tutors we generate tutor profiles and apointments on a calendar for students to book apointments with or join drop in times. I worked on managing the (no sql)firebase realtime database and firebase authentication that the app used. Integrating requst from the database into the dart frontend using Async components.

- **[Astroid Evolved](https://github.com/username/project-repo):** Astroid evolved is a remix of the popular astroids game. In this game you are defending a planet from destruction! Astroids are flying around threatening to hit and damage the planet as you go on your ship to destroy the incomming threat. The game is continuous lasting until the planet is destroyed or all three lives are lost. This is a unity based game in C# where I helped developed the user gui incluing the main menu, pausing menu, and player lives.
